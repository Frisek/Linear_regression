# Linear Regression Model for Estimating OHLC Series of Telefonica and IBEX
Machine Learning
This repository contains the code for a linear regression model that estimates Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) series for Telefonica and IBEX, two prominent companies in the Spanish stock market. The model uses historical data on daily closing prices and a range of technical indicators to predict the next day's OHLC values.

The code is written in Python and includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and testing, and visualization. The main libraries used in this project are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. The results indicate that the linear regression model is able to predict OHLC values for Telefonica and IBEX with reasonable accuracy.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in learning about linear regression models, financial data analysis, and stock market forecasting. The code and datasets can be easily replicated and adapted for other similar projects.

Feel free to explore the repository, run the code, and provide feedback. Thank you for your interest!
